Steps:
create a folder inside driver/char/. e.g. driver/char/my_c_dev
Add kconfig, describe your kernel module. tristate is config description string. CUSTOM_MOD_NAME is option appear is linux .config.
and name of module is shown as menuconfig option.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36e55324-2dbb-467f-bad2-8c9338d208f7)

Add kconfig to upper level kconfig.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23a27b33-2e95-4ecb-81ea-1663eb19b7b5)

Add Makefile, use "$(CONFIG_CUSTOM_MOD_NAME)" // check config preprended.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ec45c0c-bd6a-424c-a993-30d22243ea3f)

Add makefile to uper makefile. Linkage of path happens here.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b6a90ef-3256-46e7-86e2-8aceb71300ac)
kernel build system will come to driver/char, and will read this makefile, and it will go inside given obj-y path and usae that Makefile

comeback to linux top level directory

Minor numbers help to differencitate between device file. By major, VFS choses device file, and with minor number, which instance or which device file is used by user, that's recognized by driver. So minor are used for driver to differentiate device instance requests, and major are used by vfs for systemcall or user call forwarding which are initiated by device file.

Important data structures for file oeprations/ device file operations.

Cdev(points to file ops supported), file_ops(mentions supported file ops), file(allocated on opening of a file and stays in kernel memory. Holds process interaction with an open file), inode(stored on disk, and unique per file. Hold's file metadata)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b6be25e-3b46-40bb-b6f0-2557f724062a)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7dc3830-8694-489d-9e11-f1f353c90112)

VFS objects are file_ops, cdev, file, inode.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cc0936f-af36-42c2-8a3d-0a80fccb5426)

When device file is created, vfs functions are called. Vfs do some association using some functions as shown above.

Steps:
when device file is created (udevd does this based on indication from loading driver module via event)
	- A file is created (an inode is created and stored in memory)
	- Inode is initialised with some default values for device number and dummy file operation methods, as shown above.
 
Now wait for open callâ€¦ story starts there of actual linking of driver methods.

On each open call, and new kernel file object is created. inode holds unique information related to device.
e.g. i_rdev for dev_t type. one can get minor from this. i_cdev contains per device, cdev related info. from this cdev address from address, private device data structure or container base address can be accessed using container_of() macro.

vfs doesn't supply inode to read and write method, so we can't get this info by container_of() in these api. need to save this from other methods.
where to use?
use in file object which vfs supplies to other method. there's a private_data field, which can be used.

Premission checking is also need to be implemented here in open()
vfs calls driver's open method, with information of inode and file pointer.

Linux gives unique name to these non-discoverable or hotpluggable buses, and that name is 'platform bus'
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a90131a-37dd-4750-b1c5-4a217d319a4e)
Linux doesn't distinguish buses as i2c, spi, or l3, l4 interconnect, APB or AHB, like that. it simply says, platform bus.
from hardware perspective devices are may be connected on these different buses. but for linux it's all platfor bus. it's a pseudo bus.
and devices connected on these buses are called platform devices.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0cc1bce-37e3-4740-b237-a79baa2e6c6f)
There are on-chip peripherals and off-chip peripherals.
Below devices are platform devices, because there are not auto-discoverable by their host bus interface.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee2ed53c-e4e7-4bea-9255-9fa3ca2d8856)
Platform devices has to be part of "Linux Device Model", so that, "device information" about these devices can be fed to linux kernel at either boot or compile time.

How to register platform device?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5832e554-ad92-4592-a8a7-c55fae55b76c)

3 paths

Device tree
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86f5e5be-b287-4c21-b4da-8da84c282ee7)

Where board files are placed?
per device in arch folder all board files are preesnt. These are part of kernel source, which is a bad bad idea. supported before 3.6 kernel.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55680091-2c4c-4aa1-972f-b1f4393cba67)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccce2299-b931-4502-b3bd-27692291c2e2)

Whenever linux kernel detects a board, it jumps to devxxxx_init() function in its board file. It includes platform devices configurations, resources.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84a6c7cc-e560-4ced-a6cb-ea9e58ae01f3)

newer kernel has removed platform or board specific board files, rather it has just kept a generic board file.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebaea0b3-b093-45c5-af5c-34ed75a726c9)

this includes generic info for various board, but exact board specific details are instantiated from device tree. you won't find no platform device structure.

I am writting i2c device driver - writing driver for i2c device which is connected to i2c controller over i2c bus. i2c controller driver is most probably given by vendor itself. these are controller driver. so controller drivers are mostly available, but device drivers are to be written.

Registering platform device and platform driver
Platform driver

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57ed26b3-c1cf-4d3a-8a98-a1d3cf012a5e)

Platform device. call this function to register from board file or device setup file.

How correct driver is autoloaded whenever one add a new platform device? kernel use some matching here. we are just supposed to take care of registering right way.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c97cd61b-6860-42a0-b361-93732b3cb88e)

Matching mechanism. Every bus type has its match function.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/495587f6-5e90-4e38-9053-0f0dbea26c79)

Name based matching mechanism
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e5c2d94-431b-416b-a1ec-859d7a7819ce)

when match detected, bus driver management code determines driver for newly added device, and that driver's probe function is called with this device as an arg.

Remove function // unbinding of device to kernel framework
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16631ee7-b976-438e-b71d-a65c05efcc05)

Probe an Remove are mandatory, where as other can be implemented as per need.

Earlier we passed device private data as different structure. this will be now called as device platform data. during registration, we should register data as well.

Platform Driver code

Same as pseudo char driver. with probe and remove method difference. moreover, platform driver registration has to happen.
Also platform driver members are to be initialized. which are important??? check below.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e8476a1-742d-4542-b835-3795e7818d10)

Number of times platform_device_register() gets called, that many time, probe has to be called.

Driver unloading - Remove function is called first before cleanup, to give a chance to unbind any device before unloading driver.

Reboot machine now

for platform device setup module
pcdev_platform_init() and pcdev_platform_exit() are required.
These are calling register and unregister apis for platform device. platform device is given by platform_device structure. user defined, but some mandatory fields are there.

Platform device and driver matching technique, using platform device ids
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6eb92f6a-9460-4665-ae99-bc72e3ee146a)
- single driver store diff configs
- it detects chip - verify device id - and load respective config params, and thus config device properly
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62fffb09-93a5-411a-83e5-85d6ef3438ff)

Platform driver must support different device ids. when driver detect any id from supported range, it's a match, probe gets called, and device gets configured.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/699e12cb-dfaf-40dd-8da3-51bb35b44ce7)
modify pcd platform drier, to support different version of pcdevs. pcdev-A1x, pcdev-B1x, pcdev-C1x

device setup has name change
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/000025bf-8c10-4085-8d49-961afb4f5e7a)

in driver code, we are eliminating name based matching, and now, going for id based matching.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4e08694-408b-4a41-9b07-e5efc29d17e9)

if id table based matching is selected then driver.name based matching won't be happening
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73f5f8f0-1bec-40bd-8543-9761ddc7c1ec)

see here, last 2 options, 1st device tree based, then acpi based, then id based and then name based matching happeening.

device tree structure
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e63c12f-40cf-43a5-819c-48e7af9034b8)
device tree is collection of nodes(nodes are devices) which are related to each other with parent-child relationship
root node is required, and it's a beginning/starting point of device tree. this is the reference node.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f5a551e-95aa-4c81-a23b-c83793ade92b)
properties are used to descrive node/device.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72bc90db-c8d2-4f39-9631-6a16618b8060)
CPU and memory nodes are root level nodes

How to write?
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9893f0fc-ff73-422f-aa10-8f97e8e2c02e)
soc level DT is provided by vendors in the form of dtsi
user mostly write device tree level over-lays or add-ons for board relate changes.

Every dtree has one root node. Top level device tree file give root node, 
in board specific dts dummy root nodes are used for some overwritting of top level dtree root node.

this board device tree explains, i2c0 and i2c1 controller
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00cd225b-5196-47dc-a882-f9cf5606c987)

node name is i2c@ADDRESS. as addresses of i2c controllers are different, it's node name will be unique as well.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9af80f0-25d2-40e1-8b9e-102cbf0975d5)

for this controller, 1st register in memory map is start at this reg property specified address.
base, size of memory map are given as below.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/075919db-8a16-40cb-9156-cd4216f18279)
Check TRM(Technical reference manual of soc) to check base memory mapped address start/base for this controller.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4361574d-7e81-4eb8-b13b-a606d0968836)
so reg property should be used for creating node-name by using as unit-address.
for ease, simply use alias/lable
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28e97b35-e99b-4d73-8555-2d753692e6d9)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4577c9b6-f6c4-44a1-9c64-68ce3c0fe8d0)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1878fbd1-f2bc-4393-8e5c-2c95bad27aca)
remember reg property will only comes into picture when device has memory mapping or device addressing.
in case of absence of reg property, omit unit address.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a65b0cf-7e6b-4dba-a88c-71980de060a6)
reg property explains i2c address, as it is not on-chip device and not memory mapped, but an external hardware on BB Black HW.
communicates with soc over i2c, and hence it has separate address.

client program -- here linux, uses this to define driver.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd27cc07-bf1e-4276-9e39-25875fbcf381)
This is like, these set of or family of devices are compatible to specific driver. just like, we had device family details in platform pcd device-driver emample, and kernel used name of this to see compatibility with respective driver.

When kernel sees this compatible string, it will try to find the driver supporting the exact string.(more specific compatible driver), kernel load driver, and probe is called. if not located this, then go to next string match.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0775a851-9193-41cc-a008-282e59a0577f)


We are going to change our PCD driver implementation by using device tree method, and pass device private data as properties to the driver.

How to track supported list of SoCs?
suppose we have dtsi
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91446594-bfbb-4aaa-8a38-ce428b6cdc90)
check compatible field. we get driver details. goto/drivers/i2c/ and find i2c driver of soc family omap.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfe6041c-400e-4c8e-b9c3-e2f5bd389ab3)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c9c1bf0-fcdf-4aee-a6a3-a3e439a108b3)
go at the end, and check which platform driver is getting registered.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbd594f5-5dbe-49bf-858b-03eb4b3cd7e8)
goto that driver structure
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/765fd208-fed1-434c-8447-d3c22f98e0c5)
goto, open firmware match table
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f1c5d09-55be-41a0-ac1e-90acd5a4565a)
so this driver supports i2c controller/peripheral for all these SoCs.
so, the compatible name which we have kept in our i2c dts, is matching with one of the entry of this driver supporeted soc in driver structure's of_match_table. if status is "okay" in dtsi, then that driver's probe function is getting called.

observe, there's no driver for this tsp device, because, there's no compatible property mention, so no driver to load
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e569987-bcdb-40f6-9edc-6d4c1b68bd4d)

for second device, as it has compatible property, that driver will get loaded for this device node.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e867cc3-6022-434a-a8c1-3f49b5e4bd0c)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a30cafd-6e9e-46d3-a87d-a02c1463d11c)


But How does one know, which properties to mention, and from where to refer?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3b94703-fd2b-4bb9-8aa7-8025a1fdf702)
device driver writter is responsible to provide this details. e.g. device tree binding document
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/922146c6-adce-4de2-ae2b-739869d714b2)
device binding properties are in devicetree bindings document

See, probe executed.
removing driver

and hence matching finishes device node and driver matching done.

2 kind of methods we have seen to call probe.
1. manual way of registering device and probe gets called using device setup method
2. device tree method, where without any device registration, probe gets called.

In probe, one need to decide if probe instantiated from device setup code or due to device tree node.
and based on that, of.h helper apis can be used.

if pdata is null, then check if setupcode called this probe. and if that also fails, then message, no platform data available.
